# Icarus Verilog Version of Crazy Small CPU Version 2

This is an implementation of the CSCv2 CPU in Icarus Verilog. Assuming
that you have this installed, and you have the three *.rom files already
built in the parent directory, you can do:

```
make
```

to compile the Verilog sources here and run the CPU with those ROM images.

Note: This is the first Verilog code that I've written, so it is probably
simplistic and could be improved. Feel free to let me know how I can
improve it.
